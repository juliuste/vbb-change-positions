## Installation and Usage

If you're using `JavaScript`, you can use the package by installing:

```shell
npm install vbb-change-positions
```

```js
const readChangePositions = require('vbb-change-positions')

const changePositions = readChangePositions()
changePositions.on('data', console.log)
```

`changePositions` will be a [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) in [object mode](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_object_mode).

```js
{
    fromStation: {
        id: "de:11000:900045102",
        name: "Heidelberger Platz"
    },
    fromLines: ["S42","S46"],
    previousStation: {
        id: "de:11000:900044101",
        name: "Hohenzollerndamm"
    },
    fromPosition: 1,
    toStation: {
        id: "de:11000:900045102",
        name: "Heidelberger Platz"
    },
    toLines: ["U3"],
    nextStation: {
        id: "de:11000:900045101",
        name: "Rüdesheimer Platz"
    },
    toPosition: 1,
    samePlatform: false
}
// …
```

### Browser support

Using bundlers like [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org) or [browserify](http://browserify.org), this package will work in the browser. Keep in mind that it contains quite a lot of data (~200k uncompressed, ~10k gzipped).


## Data structure

The dataset is located in `data.ndjson`, a [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) file which you can edit using a text editor or [vbb-change-positions-cli](https://github.com/juliuste/vbb-change-positions-cli).

Let's take the following example: I want to take the `S46` in the direction of `Königs Wusterhausen` to `Heidelberger Platz`, where I want to change to the `U3` towards `Krumme Lanke`.

![an illustration of the keys](illustration.svg)

The dataset row would then contain the following information:

| key name | description | required | example |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| `fromStation` | Station at which you arrive. Object containing the keys below. | yes | `{id: "de:11000:900045102", name: "Heidelberger Platz"}` |
| `fromStation.id` | Arrival station [IFOPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_of_Fixed_Objects_in_Public_Transport) ID\* | yes | `de:11000:900045102` |
| `fromStation.name` | Arrival station name (only for readability of the dataset) | no | `Heidelberger Platz` |
| `fromLines`    | "Arriving" line names. Note that the lines must run on the same platform and share the same `fromStation`. For the lines that fit those criteria, there should exist only one dataset row grouping them, though. This key exists mostly because information on `fromTrack` is much harder to get/remember than the rather simple line names and sometimes the track changes but the platform doesn't. | yes | `["S42", "S46"]` |
| `previousStation` | Previous station on the line before changing. Object containing the keys below. | yes | `{id: "de:11000:900044101", name: "Hohenzollerndamm"}` |
| `previousStation.id` | Previous station [IFOPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_of_Fixed_Objects_in_Public_Transport) ID\* | yes | `de:11000:900044101` |
| `previousStation.name` | Previous station name (only for readability of the dataset) | no | `Hohenzollerndamm` |
| `fromTrack`| Arrival platform (track)\*\* | no | *empty*
| `fromPosition`| Number where to leave the arrival platform. Between `0` (at the rear end of the station) and `1` (at the front "driver's" end of the station) \*\*\* | yes | `1` |
| `toStation` | Station at which you depart. Mostly the same as `fromStation`, but different for interchanges like `Kaiserdamm <-> Messe Nord/ICC` that are marked as one node on the public transport map. Object containing the keys below. | yes | `{id: "de:11000:900045102", name: "Heidelberger Platz"}` |
| `toStation.id` | Arrival station [IFOPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_of_Fixed_Objects_in_Public_Transport) ID\* | yes | `de:11000:900045102` |
| `toStation.name` | Arrival station name (only for readability of the dataset) | no | `Heidelberger Platz` |
| `toLines`    | "Departing" line names, see `fromLines` | yes | `["U3"]` |
| `nextStation` | Next station on the line after changing. Object containing the keys below. | yes | `{id: "de:11000:900045101", name: "Rüdesheimer Platz"}` |
| `nextStation.id` | Next station [IFOPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_of_Fixed_Objects_in_Public_Transport) ID\* | yes | `de:11000:900045101` |
| `nextStation.name` | Next station name (only for readability of the dataset) | no | `Rüdesheimer Platz` |
| `toTrack`| Departure platform (track)\*\* | no | *empty*
| `toPosition`| Number where to enter the departure platform.\*\*\* See also `fromPosition`. | yes | `1` |
| `samePlatform` | Set to `true` if both trains stop at the same platform (entire platform, not "only" track). `fromPosition` and `toPosition` will be ignored and **should be set to `0.5`** | no | `false` |

\* See [this document](station-ids.md) if you don't know how to find out some station's VBB station [IFOPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_of_Fixed_Objects_in_Public_Transport) ID

\*\* If unknown, just leave empty/unset like I did here.

\*\*\* see [additional guidelines](#additional-guidelines)

Finally, our example would give us the following data row for the NDJSON file:

```json
{"fromStation":{"id":"de:11000:900045102","name":"Heidelberger Platz"},"fromLines":["S42","S46"],"previousStation":{"id":"de:11000:900044101","name":"Hohenzollerndamm"},"fromPosition":1,"toStation":{"id":"de:11000:900045102","name":"Heidelberger Platz"},"toLines":["U3"],"nextStation":{"id":"de:11000:900045101","name":"Rüdesheimer Platz"},"toPosition":1,"samePlatform":false}
```
### Additional guidelines

#### Parallel lines

There's a common situation where multiple lines run in parallel for a few stations in a row, like `S41/S42` and `S46` between `Westend` and `Neukölln` or `S1` and `S2` between `Yorckstraße` and `Bornholmer Straße`. A general rule of thumb for this case is that only if it's your last chance to change between two lines at a station, this specific interchange scenario should be mapped. However, if it's a common things for commuters to change at another station than the "last possible", then and only then that station should be added as well. To give you a few examples:

- `Neukölln` should be mapped for `S42@Hermannstraße -> S45/S46/S47@Köllnische Heide`, `S45/S46@Hermannstraße -> S42@Sonnenallee` and `S41/S42@Sonnenallee <-> S45/S46/S47@Köllnische Heide`, making 4 interchange scenarios. (For simplicity, I ignored the `U7` in this example, that should be mapped as well, of course).
- `Westend` should be mapped for `S46@Messe Nord/ICC -> S41@Jungernheide`, because the S46 terminates here, making it the last possible point of interchange. No other interchanges should be mapped for this station, though.
- `Plänterwald` should not be mapped at all, because it's not your *last chance* to change between any of the lines running there.
- `Priesterweg` should be mapped for 4 scenarios: `S2@Südkreuz -> S25/S26@Südende`, `S25/S26@Südkreuz -> S2@Attilastraße` and `S2@Attilastraße <-> S25/S26@Südende`
- `Heidelberger Platz` should be mapped for interchanges `S41/S42/S46 <-> U3`, but not for interchanges like `S41 -> S46` or even `S41 -> S42`
- `Flughafen Berlin-Schönefeld` Even though technically the last station to "change" between `S9` and `S45`, no interchanges should be mapped since **both** lines terminate here. For places where only one line terminates while the others continue, see the `Westend` example.
- `Jannowitzbrücke` Even though technically not the last chance to change between S-Bahn and `U8`, the interchange `S3/S5/S7/S9@Alexanderplatz <-> U8@Alexanderplatz` should be mapped, since a lot of people prefer to change at Jannowitzbrücke instead of Alexanderplatz because the ways are shorter and it's less crowded.
- `Wannsee` Same with this station. Even though one might assume people would change between `S1` and `S7` at Nikolassee, it's actually much more common to change at Wannsee, because trains stop at the same platform there. So `S7@Griebnitzsee -> S1@Nikolassee` should be added here.

#### Other

- If you're not too sure about the exact position on the platform, just take one of `0`, `0.5` or `1` that fits best, in order to prevent us from having data that seems really accurate but actually isn't.
- `fromStation` and `toStation` will mostly be the same, except for connections like `Messe Nord/ICC` and `Kaiserdamm`.
- If there are multiple ways connecting to platforms, either add separate rows for all of them or just add the shortest connection.
- `fromLines` and `toLines` must be different, `previousStation` and `nextStation` can be identical, however.
